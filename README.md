# Kaggle-Titanic

Written in Jupyter Notebook, the program features 4 machine learning models (Neural Network, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) to achieve 80-90% accuracy in determining whether a passenger will survive or not. The program splits the train dataset into train and test sets, but can be used on the test data as well.
